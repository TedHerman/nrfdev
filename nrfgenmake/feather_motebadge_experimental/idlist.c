/****************************************************
 * IMPORTANT notes.                                 *
 * 1. there are multiple idlist.c files, should be  *
 *    somehow consolidated to keep them in sync!    *
 * 2. discover new entries - currently done by      *
 *    using feather_motebadge, running it with      *
 *    Segger's JLinkExe in one window, connecting   *
 *    to the nRF52, then running JLinkRTTClient in  *
 *    another window, to get debugging. Function    *
 *    find_mac_addr below will fail, and there will *
 *    be some NRF_LOG_INFO message telling what is  *
 *    the missing MAC address, to be added to the   *
 *    addr_list below.                              *
